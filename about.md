My name is Leonardo Cesar Borges. I've been writing code, reading code, and living vicariously through computers for as long as I can remember. I also dabble in cooking and play tennis.

I'm currently an engineer at Neoway in Florian√≥polis, where I work on data processing (ingestion and processing data) using python and golang as main languague.
All opinions are my own.
